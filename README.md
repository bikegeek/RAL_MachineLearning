My RAL machine learning exercises

From Alessandro's email:
------------------snip-------------------------
Great, let's start with something simple with a single feature.
The goal of this exercise is to have a more qualitative understanding
of the ML tools you will be using.
I would recommend you to use only tools available in Scikit-learn and
to try them in a Jupiter notebook.
By doing so, we can discuss the results independently (and I can give
you my solution to the problem).
The dataset has a single feature and the goal is to produce the best
regression. I recommend you to use the mean_squared_error as measure.
The input X has been fed to a function and some noise has been added.
The goal is to have a ML mechanism that find the pattern (and produced
the best results on the test set).
Feel free to ask me all the questions you have.
